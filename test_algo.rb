# The problem is opposite of this post. We are given a stack data structure with 
# push and pop operations, the task is to implement a queue using instances of 
# stack data structure and operations on them.

# Stack and Queue with insert and delete operations

# A queue can be implemented using two stacks. 
# Let queue to be implemented be q and stacks used to implement q 
# be stack1 and stack2. q can be implemented in two ways
