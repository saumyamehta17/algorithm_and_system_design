Data Structures

* Array
  is a data structure, where data is placed at continous memory locatons. Idea is to place multiple items of same type together. 
  Advantage
  ---------
  . Fast random access using index - o(1)

  Disadvantage
  ------------
  . Fix Size
  . Inserting new elem is expensive if sorted - o(n)
  . sorting nlog(n)

* LinkedList
  a linear data structure, where elements not stored in continous memory locations, elements are linked using pointers.	

  Advantage
  ---------
  . Dynamic Size
  . Ease insertion/deletion - o(1)
  
  Disadvantage
  ------------  
  . extra space for pointers
  . No random access, need to traverse - o(n)
  . sorting nlog(n)

* Stack-LIFO/ Queue-FIFO(Usage CPU Scheduling)

  Advantage
  ---------
  push/Add - o(1)
  pop/remove - o(1)
  peek - o(1)
  
  Disadvantage
  ------------  
  search - o(n) use another ds

* Binary Search Tree
  hierarchical data structure, 		
  Advantage
  ---------
  * insert/search/del in o(h) 
  * and in o(log(n)) if bst is self balancing tree
  * better than hash for get sorted elements (Inorder travsersal), extra efforts with hash
  * order stastics - get kth smallest elem, extra efforts with hash
  
  Disadvantage
  ------------
  . extra space


* Binary Tree
  hierarchical data structure, type of a tree have atmost 2 children	
  Advantage
  ---------
  
  Disadvantage
  ------------   

* Graph
  Vertices and edges

  Advantage
  ---------
  
  Disadvantage
  ------------

* Trie
  searching word in dictonaries
  
  Advantage
  ---------
  
  Disadvantage
  ------------              

* Heap
  type of binary tree has following properties:
  its a complete binary tree where all levels are filled and last level is filled as left as possible. This property makes it suitable to be stored in array
  It can be MinHeap/MaxHeap
  
  Advantage
  ---------
  . get min/max  - o(1)
  . insertion/deletion - o(log(n))

  Disadvantage
  ------------   
  . searching - o(n) bcoz no specific order it maintains

* Hash
  
  Advantage
  ---------
  insert/del/access in o(1) 
  
  Disadvantage
  ------------
  reterival of elem in specific order not gurantee
  extra space than arrays to store hash code
