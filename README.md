## Algorithm

- [Top k frequent elements](/array/top_k_frequent_elements.rb)

- [Binary Tree Level Order zigzag](/tree/zigzag_level_order.rb)

- [Max Width of Binary Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-width-of-binary-tree/submissions/)
  Its maximum width among all levels
  
  #### Complexity Analysis
  `Time Complexity` is o(n) as I am processing each node only once in a tree **and** `Space Complexity` o(n) as adding each node in queue(BFS)
