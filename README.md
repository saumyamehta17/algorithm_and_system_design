## Algorithm

- [Top k frequent elements](/array/top_k_frequent_elements.rb)

- [Binary Tree Level Order zigzag](/tree/zigzag_level_order.rb)

- [Max Width of Binary Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-width-of-binary-tree/submissions/)
  Its maximum width among all levels
  
  #### Complexity Analysis
  `Time Complexity` is o(n) as I am processing each node only once in a tree **and** `Space Complexity` o(n) as adding each node in queue(BFS)
  
- [Valid Palindrome](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-palindrome/)

  Given a string, determine if it is a palindrome, considering only alphanumeric characters and ignoring cases.
  #### Complexity Analysis
    `Time Complexity` is o(n) as we are processing string once **and** `Space Complexity` is o(1)

- [Find All Duplicates](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-all-duplicates-in-an-array/submissions/)

  #### Complexity Analysis
     `Time Complexity` is o(n) as we are processing string once **and** no extra `space`

- [Rotting Oranges](https://leetcode.com/problems/rotting-oranges/submissions/)

  #### Complexity Analysis
     `Time Complexity` is o(m*n) **and** `space complexity` is also o(m*n)
