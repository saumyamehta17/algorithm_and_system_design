* Estimation
  Let Active Users - 800 Million out of billion users of utube
  Let One user view 5 video in a day
  1 day - 800 Million * 5 video 
  one sec - 80,00,00,000 * 5 / 86400 = 46k video

  Let read-write ratio be 200:1
  video upload per second will be = 46k/200 = 230 video per second

  Storage
  -------
  Let 500 hour worth of video is uploaded per minute
  Let one minute video has 50 MB data
  one minute storage would be = 500 * 60 min * 50MB = 1500 GB / minute
  							  = 1500 / 60 GB = 25GB/sec
