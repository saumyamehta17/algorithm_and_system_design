Hash Map is a data structure to store key-value pair. This is used to map key to value for efficient look-up. There are many ways to implement it

1) using array and linkedlist
index =  hashCode() % size_array
look in array with calculated index, and add node in that index if not already populated else add at the end of linkedlist

It will take constant time to get and set key-value in hashmap, but
if there are collisions then it will take o(n) in worst case

2) We can reduce complexity to o(logn) by using balanced tree instead of linkedlist.
