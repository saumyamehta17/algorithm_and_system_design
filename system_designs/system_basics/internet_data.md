### How data travel around the world
data/videos everything is placed on some datacenters(computers)
1) Satellite
signal can be sent to satellite and can be recieved by satellite. `Problem`, Satellite are parked 22k miles above the equator. So, to transmit the data there will latency because data has to travel 44k miles(coming and going)

2) Optical Fibre Cables are there undersea
few companies like AT&T, Orange, Google maintain these network . This is done with help of ship. Plow is dropped in the deep  in sea from ship. These cable carries lights and that is connected to the router. And then router converts these light signal to electric signal. Then this electric signal are recieved by your computer from ethernet cable. And if it is your cellular data then lights signal goes to cellular tower and from that tower it came as electical wave signal to your phone 

What is speed of light?
 186k miles per second

impact of glass on light of speed?
underseas cables has been foiled by glass again and again. When light passes though some matter, it slow down its speed 
speed? whatsapp ?

Miles around the Earth is 24901 miles or 40075 KM
```
Light Speed = 186000 Miles per second
1 Mile will take = 1/186000
24901 will take  = 24901/186000 = 0.13 second = 130 milisecond
```
